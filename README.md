# Hyderabad City Power Consumptions  
### Predict power consumption across three zones in the city by the Electricity board of Hyderabad
#### Description
You have been hired as a Data science consultant by the Electricity board of Hyderabad to predict power consumption across three zones across the city. Your forecasts will help the electricity board to plan for the projected electricity requirements and make necessary agreements to avoid at shortfall of power to the city. You’ll develop models trained on historical power consumption data across the three zones. Besides the power consumption data, you will also have some other parameters that can impact the power consumption in a region. With reasonable efforts, you should be able to get to a MAPE performance of less than 6%.  

#### Evaluation
Submissions are evaluated on MAPE (Mean Absolute Percentage Error) between predicted and actual values. Final evaluation metric is the mean of the MAPEs calculated for three zones
